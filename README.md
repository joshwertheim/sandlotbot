sandlotbot
==========

IRC bot for retrieving information specific to the San Francisco Giants (for now). This bot is a work in progress. Needs lots of refactoring. More features to come.

Feel free to submit a pull-request!

Currently uses a set of three different JSON feeds provided by the Major League Baseball website. Keep in mind that these could change at any time and break the bot's parser.
